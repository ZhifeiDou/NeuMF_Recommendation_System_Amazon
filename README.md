- MovieLens.csv
- Amazon Review.csv

Where each of the file has the content as the following:

**- MIE424 Project MovieLens.ipynb**
This is the main file where the team has reconstructed the recommand systems (NCF models) and perform the hyperparameter tuning with the movielens dataset.

To implement this file, please first download the MovieLens.csv file and make sure all the imported liburary are pre-installed.

Please note that the hyperparameter tuning result might be different wi.h the one that the team performed but it will not be various too much/

**- MIE424 Project Amazon.ipynb**
This is the file with testing the model with the best hyperparameter setting on the Aamazon Review.csv. 

To implement this file, one needs to download the Amazon Review.csv file and run the code.

**- MIE424 Project Compare SGD and Adam.ipynb**
This is the file to compare the difference between using Adam and SGD.
