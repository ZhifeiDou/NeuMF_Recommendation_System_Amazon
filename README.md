# NeuMF_Recommendation_System_Amazon
This is the final project for MIE424 Group 9. This project is building a recommendation system with NeuMF - a fusion model with Neural Network and Matrix Factorization proposed by He et al in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031).

## Project Report
The

## File structure
The folder consists of three .ipynb files and two datasets which are listed below
- MIE424 Project MovieLens.ipynb
- MIE424 Project Amazon.ipynb
- MIE424 Project Compare SGD and Adam.ipynb
- MovieLens.csv
- Amazon Review.csv

Where each of the file has the content as the following:

**- MIE424 Project MovieLens.ipynb**
This is the main file where the team has reconstructed the recommand systems (NCF models) and perform the hyperparameter tuning with the movielens dataset.

To implement this file, please first download the MovieLens.csv file and make sure all the imported liburary are pre-installed.

Please note that the hyperparameter tuning result might be different wi.h the one that the team performed but it will not be various too much/

**- MIE424 Project Amazon.ipynb**
This is the file with testing the model with the best hyperparameter setting on the Aamazon Review.csv. 

To implement this file, one needs to download the Amazon Review.csv file and run the code.

**- MIE424 Project Compare SGD and Adam.ipynb**
This is the file to compare the difference between using Adam and SGD.

To implement this file, please download the MovieLens.csv file and run the code.
